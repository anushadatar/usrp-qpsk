This directory includes data to transmit when testing the system. The general filename format should be
"PULSE_SIZE"_"HEADER_SIZE"_"LENGTH_OF_DATA".dat so a signal with a pulse size of 50, a header size of 500, and
a data length of 1000 should be 50_500_10000.dat. 

Feel free to modify this format, but please make sure that all of the filenames here are consistent.
