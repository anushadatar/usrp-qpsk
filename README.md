# Summary
This repository contains code, data, and documentation associated with a 
communication system that uses the QPSK (4-QAM) communication scheme to send and
receive information between two USRP B210 radios. Our [final report](https://github.com/anushadatar/usrp-qpsk/blob/main/docs/report.pdf) includes
more details about our implementation and the theoretical background that
informed it.
